3. Group members unprepared: 
It is understood that people are busy with other classes and school work.  If by group 
consciousness it is obvious that a member is unprepared for a meeting, and their 
unpreparedness creates a hindrance to the group and project, then disciplinary action will 
have to take place. Unpreparedness of this form will immediately result in a warning then 
a minor offence hereafter. 
4. Workload too heavy: 
If with the time restraints and number of group members actively participating is not 
sufficient enough to complete the task, a communication to the team is mandatory. If unable
to work within deadline as a team, a plea of mercy will be sent to the Rock via email 
and in person which logs the details of the amount of work to be done, the status of how 
far we are, and why we canâ€Ÿt complete it in that time period.
